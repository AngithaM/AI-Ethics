# Surveillance capitalism
Do you ever discuss purchasing a product with someone, and then mysteriously, get bombarded with the commercials for the same product across all your social media platforms? Ever viewed something on Amazon and ended up seeing the same thing on every other website you visit? Is there a secret camera over your head 24x7, leaking your personal information to others?
Well, the simple answer is - yes, our data is captured from nearly every corner of the Internet. Almost everyone who utilizes the services provided by big tech giants like Google, Meta, Amazon, or even something as workaday a smartphone, is under constant surveillance. Our private human experiences are a free source of raw material to them, and our attention is the product sold. The tech companies collect behavioural data, apply advanced computations on it, make predictions and sell them to businesses in order to manipulate the user's behaviour.

Surveillance Capitalism highlights the issue of behavioural modification, which tunes the user's behaviour using technological devices and gains our attention. How do they do that? Well, think about when you see a notification. For a split second, you had thoughts you didn't intend to have. Now, if you went ahead and clicked on it, you get sucked into spending a little bit of your time on it. We tend to look at the services provided by Google and Facebook as products we're using, but it's the other way around – we're the product. To be more specific, "it's the gradual, slight, imperceptible change in your own behaviour and perception that is the product." (Rosenstein, 2020)

The end goal of any business is money, and unsurprisingly, there are quite a few ways to monetize us. One such way is to follow you around the web and track your browser activities (including incognito - think of all the uncomfortable details someone could find there about you), browser cookies, your IP address, and many other device specific identifiers. (GEBHART, 2019) All these data are collected to perform advanced analytics by the sites you visit, or the tech giants involved in data surveillance. Furthermore, some intermediate entities known as data brokers specialize in creating in-depth profiles of individuals for advertisers. A single profile can have up to 1500 data points, including sexual preferences, browsing history, political affiliation, and even medical history. It's like having a supercomputer and hundreds of engineers watch over every single move you make, to gain more insight about you so that they can create a virtual version of you that is predictable enough to dance to their tunes.

Now that you've understood the problem, how can we solve it? The first step is acceptance, accepting that we're persuadable. When we start to see that we can be manipulated in tiny little ways that are coming close to infringing on our right to freedom, wouldn't we want to use that understanding to protect and shield ourselves from these attacks?

While on the topic of surveillance, one might use the 'nothing to hide 'argument, suggesting that you have no reason to fear or oppose these programs unless you're are afraid it will uncover your own illicit activities. Well, I want to remind you of the statement made by Edward Snowden-"Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say." (Wikipedia, 2021)

Coming back to the solution, once you're aware of the problem, you can work towards protecting yourself against it. While de-Googling yourself might be the logical way to go, let's talk about more straightforward steps. 

Choose your browser wisely.

It's true that you can limit the data you give away by blocking cookies; however, you can still be tracked by other methods using web beacons, browser fingerprinting, and other behavioural data like mouse movements, taps, pauses, and clicks. A browser can help protect you against these, and some browsers today do that. Browsers such as Edge and Safari block finger-printers using blocklists that identify them, while Firefox has a system capable of detecting activities that look like fingerprinting and alerting users. An experimental Firefox tool removes data capable of identifying the user that finger-printers could potentially use.

Other browsers like Avast Secure Browser, the Brave browser, and Apple's Safari claims to have features that obscure data, such as the browser and device configuration, and fonts and plug-ins you have installed." (Schofield, 2019) A more recent feature used in Firefox and Edge supports more secure DNS protocols.

What else can be done?

Many bodies and forums exist where data protection and privacy issues are discussed and defined. The judiciary has a crucial role here, as revealed when the European Court of Human Rights imposed a limit on 'stop and search' practices used by the police and on the amount of time data can be legally retained. There are also several international internet policy forums like the Internet Governance Forum, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the council of Europe, and conferences like HOPE and CyFy that help safeguard privacy in the digital age. In addition, laws like GDPR (in EU) should be referenced and applied at other places, making the companies justify their data collection with the regulations. The Government should put a high threshold on consent so that personal data is prohibited. Privacy by design should be mandatory to include in companys' policies. Several procedures can be included in these policies, which clearly state what will be done with the collected data and where it will be kept, what will be done in case of a data breach, how long it will be kept, and how it will be destroyed. Policies should be made to ensure that Advanced technology is used with attention, facial recognition cameras are obstructed when not required. It should also be guaranteed that our fingerprints are not collected and stored, and steps should be taken to detect unprotected websites and networks.

These may seem to be things only the Government can do, and you might be wondering what you can do. Thankfully, most of us still live in a democracy where the will of the people trumps everything else.

Let's consider the Case Study of India- here #SAVEOURPRIVACY movement was created when the Data Protection Bill to be submitted to the Parliament was found to have many flaws. The public, in this case, suspected that the data protection wasn't citizen centric as summarized below.

#SaveOurPrivacy put forth a model draft law called the Indian Privacy Code, 2018. This draft has undergone numerous emendations and has been filed twice as a private citizen's bill in the Indian Parliament. The Internet Freedom Foundation, which started this movement, has created resources for awareness and keeps engaging with the government process to ensure that privacy is protected. This movement was crucial to changing some of the more controversial clauses in the Data Protection Bill. The latest version was submitted to Parliament on Dec 16, 2021 and is expected to pass. While not without its flaws, it has come a long way from the version presented in 2018, and the awareness among the people helped in keeping the Government in check.
Any country can adopt similar strategies, given that the people are informed, and we hope this article takes you one step closer.
